# Reinforcemnrt Learning in TORCS simulator
In this thesis work, we will try to apply reinforcement learning to train our car in TORCS simulator which is considered as one of the most popular simulation platforms for racing that could be used for training autonomous cars. There are many algorithms of RL that could be applied in autonomous driving like Q-learning, DQN (Deep Q-learning), A3C (asynchronous advantage actor critic). First, we selected Q-learning algorithm as a discrete action algorithm to train our agent, it uses Q-table to store the states and actions Q-Values. As expected, results show that Q-learning suffers from taking discrete actions so, it is not applicable in autonomous driving that need to continuous actions. Secondly, we applied the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) Algorithm as a continuous action algorithm to solve the problems of Q- learning. DDPG is a reinforcement learning technique that combines both Q-learning and Policy gradients that can learn policies in high-dimensional, continuous action space. It was proven that DDPG has smoother and better performance than Q-learning. We modified the used reward function to get better reward values. The modified model improves the stability and learning time of TORCS. The average reward is increased and the smoothness is greatly improved with the modified reward model.
